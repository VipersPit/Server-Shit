Viper's Pit is going to try the Frontier Brain league system that cares originally introduced in Meteor Falls.

Frontier Brains specialize in some part of battling. What part that is depends on what Frontier Brain you are. Some Frontier Brains also have restrictions for their challengers.


Every Frontier Brain has two stages (and as a result two teams): Silver Medal and Gold Medal. The Frontier Brain keeps track of their challenger's medals in their respective thread. Silver Medal is the "easy" stage, as Frontier Brain it is not the goal to make an undefeatable team, instead, try to leave some holes in your team and playstyle. Gold Medal on the other hand is the real shit. Expect the Frontier Brain to go all out.

Frontier Brains are in fact allowed to change teams, however they have to follow the rule of having a weaker team for the Silver Medal.

Here are the Frontier Brain positions with their description. If you are a Frontier Brain, you have to post this at the start of your thread (you can't have custom rules).
